WSL = Windows subsystem for Linux

**Goal for tonight** = Upload a file from laptop to GitHub using Git bash

Gitbash cmds-
==pwd== = print working directory, aka 'where are you currently'?
==cd== = change directory
==clear== = clear screen
==cd ..== = go up 1 folder
==mkdir== = make directory
==touch== (+ filename) = make a text file from cmd
==rm== (+ filename) = remove file                                   [Do NOT use this command in your root folder]

NTS2: All folders in Git bash have a '/' at the end


Path for testing = C:\Users\Study\Documents\TheoWAF\class7\AWS\Classes\wk3_github\92325test

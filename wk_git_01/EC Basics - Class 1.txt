EC Basics - Class 1

Task - Building an EC2 (Server) with a custom script

Foundation notes

We used a template -  template ==> https://github.com/BashiM1/bmc5/blob/main/ec2scrpit ---> copy ec2script (COPY RAW TEXT)	

Steps
0 - Go to search bar and type in ec2
1. Create a NEW security group (located in the side bar) > DO NOT USE DEFAULT
1.1 - Select security group in side bar 
1.2 - We were using default security group in this example so did not need to 
	1.2 - WE ONLY USED DEFAULT TO SHOW ERROR. CREATE NEW SECURITY GROUP AND 	PASTE THE SAME NAME INTO THE DESCRIPTION
1.3 - Select rule for inbound rules
	- In the Type drop down select http 
	- In the source, change to anywhere ipv4
	- Description - Type in webpage (optional)
1.4 - Create security group 
2 - Create EC2 (Instances)
2.1 - Select instance  
2.2 - Give it  a name
2.3 (Settings) - 
	 - Application and OS (did not touch for this class)
	- Instance type (t3 micro - did not touch for this class)
	- Key Pair(create a new keypair)(We copied name of server and pasted 		into keypair name - Setting RSA and .pem)
		Note - Key pair ALLOWS YOU TO CONNECT SECURELY TO YOUR 			VIRTUAL MACHINE VIA SECURE SHELL (SSH)
		Once create new key pair a file will download
	- Network settings - Select default
	- Configure and storage - No change 
	- Advanced details - ignore everything apart from the user data
2.4 - Launch instance
3 - Copy public DNS (This is where the server/EC/VM will be accessible over the internet
3.1 - Make sure type http:// in browser before paste public DNS
e.g. http://ec2-18-171-228-135.eu-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com


IN CLASS WE USED DEFAULT SECURITY GROUP JUST TO SHOW THE DANGERS - MOST OF TIME DO NOT USE WHICH IS WHY THE URL DID NOT WORK IN FIRST RUN

Important to delete instance via instance state > terminate instance

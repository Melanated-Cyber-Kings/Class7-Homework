Listen up, choombas. This is the **AWS Class Operations Log** for **THEO WAF**. Don't screw it up. This is where we dump our weekly brain-fry, collaborate (reluctantly), and pretend we know what we're doing. Survival means keeping the data flowing, so let's try not to flatline the repo.

## 📖 Operation Directives: The Workflow (Don't Deviate)

Think of these as the unwritten rules of the street. Follow them, or end up flatlined.

<details open>
<summary>🟢 Directive 01: Initializing Local Port (The Basics)</summary>

First rule of Night City: know your turf. Get the main grid to your local rig.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Melanated-Cyber-Kings/Class7-Homework.git
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>🔵 Directive 02: Syncing Remote Data-Stream (Avoid Headaches)</summary>

Before you drop your own trash, grab the latest from the collective. Seriously, save yourself the merge conflicts.
```bash
# First, jack into your designated sub-net
git checkout your-branch-name

# Then, pull the latest data-stream. Don't ask questions.
git pull origin your-branch-name
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>🟡 Directive 03: Data-Vault Structuring (Pretend You're Organized)</summary>

Even street samurai need to know where their gear is. Don't make a bigger mess.
📂 Set up weekly drop zones: `Week_01_Drop`, `Week_02_Drop`, etc.
📌 All your weekly garbage goes into its designated folder. Don't mix 'em.
</details>

<details>
<summary>🟣 Directive 04: Forging Your Personal Sub-Net (Your Own Corner of Chaos)</summary>

Keep your mess contained. Your own private little digital sandbox.
```bash
git checkout -b Your-Name-Homework-Branch
```
✅ **Critical Protocol:** Double-check you're in your own damn branch. We don't need your errors infecting the main.
</details>

<details>
<summary>📝 Directive 05: Log Your Traces (Prove You Did Something)</summary>

Nobody believes you unless it's written down. Make it look legit.
📝 A `README.md` is required in each weekly data-vault.
Make your documentation so clear a drunk corpo could follow it. No excuses.
</details>

<details>
<summary>📤 Directive 06: Final Data-Drop & Upload (The Moment of Truth)</summary>

The moment of truth. Don't choke.
1.  All completed data goes into its proper weekly vault.
2.  Prep the payload: `git add .`
3.  Seal the deal: `git commit -m "feat: Week X Drop | [Your Handle] | Status: Uploaded (mostly)"`
4.  Initiate secure upload: `git push origin Your-Name-Homework-Branch`
🎯 Make sure it's clean, readable, and doesn't look like you just woke up from a three-day B&E. THEO's watching.

✨ **Stay frosty, try not to flatline, and maybe, just maybe, we'll all make it through this week. Good luck, choom.** ✨

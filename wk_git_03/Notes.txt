Type in Git Bash in windows search



Git Bash is a shell aka a programme that allows you to directly interact with the computer. 

GUI (graphical user interface) - The part that you see when you’re not directly interacting with the computer

Git bash > Run as administrator



Typing in pwd 

pwd/ print working directory gives you an idea of where you are in the document or what the gitbash is seeing. You may need to give gitbash or powershell a specific route so you can move according or take the necessary actions 

Typing in ls allows you to then see the folders in that directory 


If it is not showing the path you want you need to change directory 

Cd = change directory 

Type e.g. cd documents in git bash <<< Takes to new route << in this example documents

cd .. goes back up a level or area 




THIS TYPE OF WORK is key why you need to have organised directories

If you type in mkdir <<< this will create new folder WITHIN the folder you’re in ( in the directory you’re in) via the shell and appear in gui once refreshed

To create file in the folder via the shell type “touch” followed by the file name




To remove file in the folder via the shell type “rm” followed by the file name



Make sure you are specific with what delete as you NEVER wnt to delete route.
